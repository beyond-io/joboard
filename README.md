# JoBoard Project

Project Groot is an open-source garden management system. In its core, Project Groot is a regular automatic plant growing system: it reads data from humidity and light sensors and decides when to give the plants more water, less water, more light or less light. What differentiates Project Groot from other garden management systems, is that it allows users to write their own growth plans for different plants. Users can then share their growth plans through the Groot network and users can also download and review plans from other users. Project Groot can also manage various plants with different sensors and growth plans at the same time.
JoBoard is an open-source jobs search engine system.
In it's source, it searches for jobs in companys' websites according to the filters or search words inserted by the user. What differenciates this project from other job search engines, is that it allows the user to filter the results wanted by: location, scopes, key words. It also saves the jobs the user submmited to in a personalized list, so the user will have a faster access to the jobs he alreay submmited.
