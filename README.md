# JoBoard Project

JoBoard is an open-source jobs search engine system. 
In it's source, it searches for jobs in companys' websites according to the filters or search words inserted by the user.What differenciates this project from other job search engines, is that it allows the user to filter the results wanted by: location, scopes, key words. It also saves the jobs the user submmited to in a personalized list, so the user will have a faster access to the jobs he alreay submmited.
